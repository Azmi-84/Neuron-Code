The global energy crisis, coupled with the pressing necessity for sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, has catalyzed intensified research initiatives focused on renewable energy sources. Within this context, biofuels have garnered significant scholarly attention owing to their capacity to alleviate climate change, diminish reliance on petroleum-derived fuels, and foster a circular economy. Notably, while first and second-generation biofuels, which are derived from food crops and lignocellulosic biomass, have made advancements in renewable energy generation, they simultaneously present complications concerning land utilization, food security, and resource efficiency. In contrast to terrestrial crops, algae do not compete for arable land or freshwater resources, thereby presenting a sustainable alternative characterized by diminished environmental impacts. Furthermore, algae exhibit the capability to flourish in a variety of environments, such as saline, brackish, and wastewater systems, thereby facilitating the integration of biofuel production with wastewater treatment and nutrient recycling.
